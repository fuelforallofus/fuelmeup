# Fuel Distribution Solution for Sri Lanka (Proposed)

Due to limited supply of fuel in the country, consumers are facing enormous difficulties to get their allocated quota pumped up for their vehicles without a hassle. Considering the need, a group of an independent and voluntary software experts decided to propose a solution to address all the problems listed in the problem statement below. This space is open for more volunteers who would like to contribute for a worthy cause.

## Problem Statement
Customers are waiting in the line on the road unknowingly when can get their allocated fuel quota pumped up for their vehicles.

## Proposed Solution Goals

1. Every individual should get their guaranteed fuel quota purchased in less than 10 mins in the line on the road.
2. Smart phones as well as feature phones users should be able to use the proposed solution without a hassle.
3. Availability of a Smart Phone with Fuel station staff should not be a mandatory requirement.
4. Minimize or eradicate misconduct/misuse of the system, by all stakeholders introducing active actionable feedback mechanism.

## Proposed Solution

Proposed solution is twofold and is trying to address problems mentioned in the problems statement.

1. Customer request for fuel, mentioning the city that the customer is expecting to get their fuel from.

> Feature phones users Send SMS with your city code XXXX to 1919. Smart phone users can login to FuelPass portal and select your city and click "Request Fuel"

2. The system notifies the customer a date and time which you get a guaranteed amount of fuel from the requested city.

> Customer receives an SMS with the timeslot and the station.
