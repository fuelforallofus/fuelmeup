# Fuel Me Up

## Problem Statement

1. Limited available stock shall distribute among consumers evenly.
2. Consumers shall not waste their time waiting on queues without knowing when they can get their fuel pumped.
3. Guaranteed amount of fuel should be available for the consumers for the given date and time.
3. Minimize (or make it zero) misuse of valuable stock by fuel station staff as well as others.
4. Smart phones as well as feature phones (if possible, no phone at all) should be able to support, proposed solution.
5. Empower consumers for active feedback mechanism to prevent misconduct by stakeholder.
6. None-tech savvy people should also be able to use the system without a hassle.

## Proposed Solution Flow Chart

Proposed solution is two fold.

1. Customer request intention of fuel load slot for a city that the custome expect for.
2. When fuel available for dispatch into a city/station, the system shall notify the customer with a date and time to obtain fuel.
