# Fuel Distribution Solution for Sri Lanka (Proposed)

Due to limited supply of fuel in the country, consumers are facing enormous difficulties to get their allocated quota pumped up for their vehicles without a hassle. Considering the need, a group of an independent and voluntary software experts decided to propose a solution to address all the problems listed in the problem statement below. This space is open for more volunteers who would like to contribute for a worthy cause.

## Problem Statement


1. Every individual should get an equal opportunity to get their fuel quota purchased without waiting long lines wasting time on the road.
2. When consumers arrive at the fuel station on a given date and time, in less than 10 minutes the customer should be served.
3. Guaranteed amount of fuel should be available for the consumers for the given date and time.
3. Minimize (or make it zero) misuse of valuable stock by fuel station staff as well as other stakeholders.
4. Smart phones as well as feature phones (if possible, no phone at all) users should be able to use the proposed solution without a hassle.
5. Empower consumers for active feedback mechanism to prevent misconduct by stakeholder.
6. None-tech savvy people friendly solution.

## Proposed Solution

Proposed solution is twofold and is trying to address problems mentioned in the problems statement.

1. Customer request for fuel, mentioning the city that the customer is expecting to get their fuel from.

> Feature phones users Send SMS with your city code XXXX to 1919. Smart phone users can login to FuelPass portal and select your city and click "Request Fuel"

2. The system notifies the customer a date and time which you get a guaranteed amount of fuel from the requested city.

> Customer receives an SMS with the timeslot and the station.

### Customer Request for fuel Flow Chart

3. Solution APIs to be documented.

4. Test infrastructure setup to be installed.

5. Letâ€™s get together and implement this solution for all of us.

## Thank you for your kind contribution!
